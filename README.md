# jcov-build
As at the official site of JCov the release download doesn't work anymore, and some of the Ant build dependencies were not so easy to download for me, I decided to create this repository with JCov built prerequisite .jars and also jcov.jar built itself, to make it easy for others to try this tool, without having to build it themselves (which I recommend)

You can checkout original JCov sources here: hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jcov

I prepared an article about using JCov code coverage tool, you can find it here: http://blog.mwrobel.eu/dynamic-java-e2e-code-coverage/
